## Overview

The Schrödinger equation is fundamental in quantum mechanics, and solving it can often be complex and time-consuming. The Matrix Numerov method optimizes this process, allowing for quick and efficient solutions with minimal code. By using a skilled mathematical approach, this implementation demonstrates how complex problems can be tackled in significantly less time and with fewer lines of code compared to traditional methods.

## Features

- **Efficient Calculation**: The Matrix Numerov method reduces computational time while maintaining accuracy.
- **Compact Code**: The implementation is designed to be short and understandable, emphasizing clarity and efficiency.
- **Wavefunction Visualization**: The results can be easily visualized to understand the behavior of quantum states.

## Getting Started
